## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Trying to stay a technical renaissance man, I like building systems on all kinds of levels. From optimizing cache-line hits on an assembly level to nice REST APIs and ensuring consitency in event driven microservices.

Been dabbeling with various projects since i was like 10 y.o, although intensity has gone up and down with life.
And the majority has been outside git.
